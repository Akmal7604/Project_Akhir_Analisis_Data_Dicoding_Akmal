# Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics

This project serves as the final assignment for the Data Analysis using Python course. In this project, I utilized the Bike Sharing Dataset to conduct a comprehensive data analysis. The process began with gathering data from the dataset, followed by assessing and cleaning of the data to ensure its quality and integrity. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends, resulting in informative insights. Additionally, I applied data visualization techniques to present the findings visually, making them easier to understand. Finally, I successfully deployed the analysis application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the analysis results and make predictions about bike rentals based on weather factors
